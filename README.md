# hello-world

We will be using this repository to test the bot.  
The bot currently responds to: 
1. Opening new issues
2. Opening new pull requests
3. Commenting on issues/pull requests

The bot will prompt you to fill a CLA for the first time. After you fill it up, it won't create any further noise.  
Please feel free to test it in any of the above ways.  
(This is a Work-in-Progress)
(Testing!)
